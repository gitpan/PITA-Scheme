	- Fixed misspelled method name in Scheme.pm

0.06  Tue  3 Jan 2006
	- Added the concept of request identifiers, because embedding
	  that information inside the ResultServer isn't going to work

	- Initial implementation
	- Completes sequence up to prepare_package
	- Releasing to get some early CPAN Testers results
	  (As this needs to be highly platform neutral)
