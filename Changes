Revision history for Perl extension PITA::Scheme

0.06  Tue  3 Jan 2006
	- Added the concept of request identifiers, because embedding
	  that information inside the ResultServer isn't going to work
	  once we add more functionality and make it a SupportServer.

0.05  Tue  3 Jan 2006
	- One of the tests need Mobule::Build to be available

0.04  Tue  3 Jan 2006
	- Accidentally left a Build file in Brian the test dummy.
	  This was causing test problems

0.03  Mon  2 Jan 2006
	- Module::Build manual suggests more compatible in more places to
	  use C<perl Build>/etc than C<./Build>
	- Incrementing PITA::Report dep

0.02  Mon  2 Jan 2006
	- Completed what should be the first usable version
	- Completed Scheme modules for perl5, perl5.make, perl5.build
	- Should be able to put the results to the server if told where.

0.01  Sat 31 Dec 2005
	- Initial implementation
	- Completes sequence up to prepare_package
	- Releasing to get some early CPAN Testers results
	  (As this needs to be highly platform neutral)
