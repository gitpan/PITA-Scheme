NAME
    PITA::Scheme - PITA Testing Schemes

SYNOPSIS
      # Have the scheme load up from the provided config
      my $scheme = PITA::Scheme->new(
            injector => $injector,
            workarea => $workarea,
            );
  
      # Prepare to run the tests
      $scheme->prepare_all;
  
      # Run the tests
      $scheme->execute_all;
  
      # Send the results back to the server
      $scheme->put_report;

DESCRIPTION
    While most of the PITA system exists outside the guest testing images
    and tries to have as little interaction with them as possible, there is
    one part that needs to be run from inside it.

    PITA::Scheme objects live inside the image and does three main tasks.

    1. Unpack the package and prepare the testing environment

    2. Run the sequence of commands to execute the tests and capture the
    results.

    3. Package the results as a PITA::Report and send it to the
    PITA::Host::ResultServer.

    This functionality is implemented in a module structure that is highly
    subclassable. In this way, PITA can support multiple different testing
    schemes for multiple different languages and installer types.

Setting up a Testing Image
    Each image that will be set up will require a bit of customisation, as
    the entire point of this type of testing is that every environment is
    different.

    However, by keeping most of the functionality in the PITA::Scheme
    objects, all you should need to do is to arrange for a simple Perl
    script to be launched, that feeds some initial configuration to the
    PITA::Scheme object.

    And it should do the rest. Or die... but we'll cover that later.

METHODS
    Please excuse the lack of details for now...
